      No body is born smart. We all start at 0. Can't talk, can't walk, certainly can't do algrbra. <br>
      Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody's good at anything at first.<br>
      There was a time where Einstein couldn't count to 10.<br>
      And Shakespeare has to learn his ABC's just like the rest of us.<br>
      Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
      Slowly. surely. You stumble slip fall, crawl and fail and fall.<br>
      Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
      Until one day yo walk.<br>
      One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
      Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
      Failing is just another word for growing and you keep going.<br>
      This. Is. Learning.<br>
      It's not that you don't get it.<br>
      You just don't get it yet.
      Because the most beautiful complex concept in the universe.<br>
      are built on basic ideas that anyone anywhere can understand.<br>
      whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>

      You only have to know one thing:<br>
      you can learn anything.
